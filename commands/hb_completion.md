## hb completion

Generate shell completion script for hb

### Synopsis

Generates a shell completion script for hb.
	NOTE: The current version supports Bash only.
		  This should work for *nix systems with Bash installed.

	By default, the file is written directly to /etc/bash_completion.d
	for convenience, and the command may need superuser rights, e.g.:

		$ sudo hb completion
	
	Add `--completionfile=/path/to/file` flag to set alternative
	file-path and name.

	For e.g. on OSX with bash completion installed with brew you should 

	$ hb completion --completionfile $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/hb.sh

	Logout and in again to reload the completion scripts,
	or just source them directly:

		$ . /etc/bash_completion
		
	or using if using brew
	
		$ . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion

```
